# KIDNEY DISEASE PROJECT

## Overview

Two-part project containing **FAKE** patient records.

### Part A
A python script that processes health records and blood tests to identify individuals who should be contacted to proactively engage for care.
The script should automatically screen patients for chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Refer to Files **ajakueka_ckd_screening** and **ckd.results.csv**.

### Part B
The script is refactored to include Patient Age, Height, Weight, Calculated BMI, Sex, and eGFR. The results are converted to a pandas dataframe in a jupyter notebook which provides an analysis on the output population.

Refer to Files **new_milestone01_script**, **final_output.csv**, and **main.ipynb** for analysis.
